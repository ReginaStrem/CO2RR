Synthesis of Cu–MOF–CF
CuSO4·5H2O (0.2 mmol), L1 (0.1 mmol), L2 (0.1 mmol), and NaOH (0.2 mmol) were dispersed in H2O (10 mL) with a Cu foil (1 cm × 4 cm). The Cu foil (CF, CF1, CF2, or CF3 from different commercial sources) was cleaned with dilute hydrochloric acid and ethanol with sonication for 10 min followed by washing with water; and then, the Cu foil was immersed in the additionally corresponding NaOH aqueous solution for 15 min[63] before putting it into the reaction solution. Then, the mixture was transferred into an 18 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 72 h.[47, 62, 64, 65] After cooling to room temperature, the blue electrocatalyst was obtained, washed with water, and named as Cu–MOF–CF , Cu–MOF–CF1, Cu–MOF–CF2 or Cu–MOF–CF3 corresponding to the CF, CF1, CF2 or CF3.

Samples of Cu–MOF–CF-1, Cu–MOF–CF-2, and Cu–MOF–CF-3 with different amounts of Cu–MOF were achieved in the same way using different concentrations of the copper salt, ligands, and NaOH, namely CuSO4·5H2O: 0.15, 0.25, and 0.3 mmol; L1: 0.075, 0.125, and 0.15 mmol; L2: 0.075, 0.125, and 0.15 mmol; and NaOH: 0.15, 0.25, and 0.3 mmol, respectively, while the Cu foil (1 cm × 4 cm) was kept unchanged. Cu–MOF was obtained by the same procedure without addition of Cu foil.
