Methods
Synthesis of 20% CuO/CuSiO3: 760 mg of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O was dissolved in 100
mL of an aqueous solution and placed in a 150 mL beaker. Subsequently, 1 g of SiO2
was added into the solution under magnetic stirring. Ammonium hydroxide was added,
S3
dropwise, into the solution under magnetic stirring until the pH of the suspension was
11 and stirred for 6 h. The suspension was heated at 80 ℃ in a water bath to allow for
the evaporation of ammonia and the subsequent deposition of Cu species on silica until
the pH of the suspension was 6.5. Then the mixture was solvothermally treated at 200 ℃
for 12 h. The sample was collected by centrifugation at 8,000 rpm for 5 min, and washed
4 times with ultrapure water and then dried at 120 ℃ for 4 h. Finally, the sample was
calcined at 400 ℃ for 4 h in static air and the heating rate is 5 ℃/min. The final calcined
product was designed as 20% CuO/CuSiO3. The different loading of CuO/CuSiO3 was
adjusted by adding a defined amount of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O to yield 2, 15, 30 wt. % of Cu
in the final catalysts.
Characterization
The structure and morphology of the products were characterized using XRD
(Bruker D8 Focus) and TEM (JEOL JEM-2100). The valence state of Cu of the
products was characterized by Confocal Raman Microscopy (HORIBA, LabRAM HR
Evolution). Electrochemical experiments were carried out by CHI 660E
electrochemical analyzer (CHI Instrument, CHN). The gas phase products were
detected on-line by gas chromatography (Ruimin GC 2060, Shanghai), and the liquid
phase products were detected by head-space sampling (BCHP, HS-2) and
chromatography (Agilent GC 7890B). In situ attenuated total reflection-infrared (ATRIR) spectroscopy and CO Fourier-transform IR spectroscopy were measured by a
Nicolet Is50 FT-IR spectrometer.
