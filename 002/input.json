2.2. Synthesis of the cubic-Cu2O, octahedron-Cu2O and dodecahedron-Cu2O
Cu2O MPs were synthesized according to previous report[20]. In a typical synthesis, 250 mg of CuSO4·5H2O was dissolved in 40 mL of DI water. Then oleic acid (0.5 mL for c-Cu2O, 2.5 mL for o-Cu2O, and 4.5 mL for d-Cu2O) and 20 mL ethanol was added into the solution under vigorous stirring. The solution was heated to 100 ℃, and then 10 mL of NaOH aqueous solution (0.8 M) was added dropwise into the mixture solution. Five minutes later, 30 mL of D-(+)-glucose aqueous solution (0.6 M) was added dropwise into the suspension. After that, the suspension was stirred for another 30 min for c-Cu2O, 60 min for o-Cu2O and 120 min for d-Cu2O. After the reaction, the product was collected by centrifugation and the precipitate was washed six times using ethanol and cyclohexane, then dried in a vacuum oven overnight.

2.3. Synthesis of the polyhedral 50-facet-Cu2O
0.12 g (CH3COO)2Cu·H2O was dissolved in 56 mL of DI water and 4 mL of ethanol mixture solution. After heating the solution to 60 °C, 10 mL NaOH aqueous solution (0.85 M) was added dropwise into the solution. Ten minutes later, 30 mL D-(+)-glucose aqueous solution (0.1 M) was added dropwise into the mixture. Then keep heating for another 15 min. The mixture was kept stirring thought the whole reaction. After the reaction was collected by centrifugation and the precipitate was washed three times using ethanol and water, then dried in a vacuum oven overnight.
